### Arbitrarily Sized Viewports (1%)
My program supports arbitrarily sized viewports, which can be changed through the UI.  This includes square or rectangular viewports of any size.

### Off-Axis & Rectangular Projections (1%)
My program supports off-axis and rectangular projections.  The projection window can be changed through the UI.  This includes backward projections, so projections from low to high and high to low values are supported in left/right and bottom/top pairs.  Changing the projection window affects the eye and center positions, which are automatically adjusted to match.  Translation with respect to the eye and center positions are performed by the view matrix, not the projection matrix.

### Multiple Lights @ Arbitrary Locations (1%)
My program supports multiple lights, a maximum of 16 due to WebGL restrictions, at arbitrary locations and with arbitrary colors.

### Smooth Shading w/ Vertex Normals (3%)
My program supports smooth shading with vertex normals.

### Render Ellipsoids (4%)
Attempted, but abandoned due to time restrictions.
